## Concept
>This project is a stimulation of Rubber ducky bad USB, in some pays, we don't have permission to buy Rubber ducky or to ship it, this project is about to create Rubber ducky with a Arduino Leonardo.
### Explanation
>Arduino Leonardo or Arduino micro is working with processor ATmega32u4, it's like a keyboard, it will send binary code to the OS to play keyboard role, then the operating system will take this like clicking on a keyboard then we can easily write a script that open cmd then send HttpRequest and download payload and auto execute payload.
```diff 
- This project is made with Arduino Leonardo, Battery, 3 Buttons,Breadboard, some resistors and some cables, and USB to Micro USB,We have configuration button, we configure with it the keyboard type (azerty,....) this code implements Six language..., reset button back to default (US keyboard) and Start button to start exploiting the OS. With a battery, we can do preconfiguration of the tool, like we know that the machine is using azerty we can preconfigure it, then when we connect the USB to the Machine we should only click on start button
```
